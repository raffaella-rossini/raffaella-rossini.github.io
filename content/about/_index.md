## ...this website
This is the place where I **put in order my thoughts** about **Digital HR, People & Culture, Employee Experience** (and about myself too).

You'll see here contents in both **Italian and English**: 
- Italian is my native language, and I'll use it whenever I'll feel the need to stick to it.
- English is the language I use at work, and anything related to work will be written in English, as a way to practice (and, hopefully, improve).

## ...and its owner

:wave: I'm raffaella and I enjoy **the great outdoors**: I love hiking, swimming, gardening, and travelling.

**Sustainability** runs in my veins. My relationship with stuff is all about **reducing, reusing, repairing, recycling, restoring**, and I welcome any opportunity, albeit small, to contribute to protect our environment.

**Cats or dogs? Both!** I am the happy owner of a cat (well, she is actually the one owning me...) and a dog, and they can always put **a smile on my face** :heart:

I relax by watching movies and TV series, listening to music (mainly through my beloved [radioparadise](https://radioparadise.com/home)), and reading (current reading: [Redesigning Work, by Lynda Gratton](https://lyndagratton.com/books/redesigning-work-how-to-transform-your-organisation-and-make-hybrid-work-for-everyone)).

**Making things happen** through **teamwork and collaboration** is what makes me thrive, especially when I can contribute to **continuous improvement and engagement** in the workplace, which I believe is pivotal for productivity, innovation, customer satisfaction, and, on a personal level, happiness and wellbeing.

I have been lucky enough to explore different interests and develop knowledge in the domains of **Marketing, Product Development, and People and Culture**, to work with people from across **all company levels**, from interns to executives, to **lead projects, teams and change** in a **multicultural environment** that went through significant evolutionary periods, including acquisitions, integrations, ...a pandemic, and the growth from a start-up to a mature business.

My journey hasn't been following a linear trajectory, and I hope to **keep learning and exploring** also for years to come :sparkles:
