This is the place where I **put in order my thoughts** about **Company Culture, Employee Experience, Digital HR** (and about myself too).

Back in August 2006 I started my personal blog, on a Wordpress installation that I was managing by myself. It was named _'linearemente'_ ('in a linear fashion'), as a sort of reminder to keep things simple.<br>
It got silent in August 2011, when I basically moved to Facebook and Twitter.<br>
Fast forward to October 2022, and here I am again, feeling the need to write down my thoughts in a longer form, as a way to **consolidate my learnings**. 

You'll see here contents in both **Italian and English**: 
- Italian is my native language, all the old posts that I ported here are written in Italian, and I'll use it again whenever I'll feel the need to stick to it.
- English is the language I use at work, and anything related to work will be written in English, as a way to practice (and, hopefully, improve).

A few words about myself...

## From a private standpoint

I enjoy **the great outdoors**: I love hiking, swimming, gardening, and travelling.

I am passionate about **sustainability**. My relationship with "stuff" is all about **reducing, reusing, repairing, recycling, restoring**, and I welcome any opportunity, albeit small, to contribute to protect our environment.

**Cats or dogs? Both!** I am the happy owner of a cat (well, she is actually the one owning me...) and a dog, and **they can always put a smile on my face!**

I love watching movies and TV series, listening to music (mainly through my beloved [radioparadise](https://radioparadise.com/home)), and reading (current reading: [The Fearless Organisation, by Amy C. Edmondson](https://fearlessorganization.com/the-fearless-organization)).

## From a professional standpoint

If I had to summarise in a few keywords my areas of interest I would say

>**Company Culture**<br>
>**Employee Experience**<br>
>**Digital HR**<br>

I love **‘making things happen’** through **teamwork and collaboration**, especially when I can contribute to **continuous improvement and engagement** in the workplace, which I believe is pivotal for productivity, innovation, customer satisfaction, and, on a personal level, happiness and wellbeing.

I have been lucky enough to explore different interests and develop knowledge in the domains of **Marketing, Product Development, and People and Culture**, to work with people from across **all company levels**, from interns to executives, to **lead projects, teams and change** in a **multicultural environment** that went through significant evolutionary periods, including acquisitions, integrations, a pandemic, and the growth from a start-up to a mature business.

As you can see, my journey hasn't been following a linear trajectory, and I hope to keep learning and exploring also for years to come :sparkles:
