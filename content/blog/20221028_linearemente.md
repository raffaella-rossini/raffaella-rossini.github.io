Once upon a time, I had a personal blog, named _'linearemente'_ ('in a linear fashion') - as a sort of reminder to myself to **keep things simple**.

It was August 2006, everybody was blogging about something, and I didn't want to miss the party, so I started blogging too :smile:. Moreover, back then I was into web design, so I took care of everything by myself: look and feel, Information Architecture, html and css, managing Wordpress, webanalytics... Here you have a copy (the website is still alive, but I won't renew anymore the domain name nor the hosting, so I've downloaded it to somehow preserve it).<br>
It got silent in August 2011, when I basically moved my thoughts to Facebook and then Twitter.<br> 
Fast forward to October 2022, and here I am again, feeling the need to write down my thoughts in a longer form, as a way to **consolidate my learnings**.
