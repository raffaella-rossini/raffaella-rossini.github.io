Once upon a time, I had a personal blog, named _'linearemente'_ ('in a linear fashion', as a sort of reminder to myself to **keep things simple**).

It was August 2006, everybody was blogging about something, and I didn't want to miss the party, so I started blogging too :smile:. Moreover, back then I was into web design, so I took care of everything by myself: look and feel, Information Architecture, html and css, managing Wordpress, webanalytics... [Here you have it](http://www.linearemente.it) (until July 2023, when I won't renew anymore neither the domain name nor the hosting).

It got silent in August 2011, when I basically moved to Facebook and then Twitter, and writing became a matter of jotting down some short sentences, posting pictures, reacting to contents produced by others, or reposting them.

Fast forward to October 2022, and here I am again, feeling the need to write down my thoughts in a longer form, as a way to **consolidate my learnings**, as it was back then when I started writing for the first time.
