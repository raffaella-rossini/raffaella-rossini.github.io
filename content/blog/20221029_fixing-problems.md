I like orchids, and when I was younger I tried several times to grow one, without any success: after a couple of weeks they were all gone.<br>
Fast forward to July 2022 when our neighbour, who is the proud owner of a dozen orchids that are in constant bloom, gifted me one for my birthday.
I was like “Oh no, here we go again”, but three months have passed and it is still with us, as beautiful as it was the day it entered our house.<br> 

*What am I doing differently?*

>**I am leaving it alone!**

All the others died because of **too much misguided care**: I was constantly watering them, and trying to enrich the soil. This time, it’s just a few drops of water now and then, and it is working.

Sometimes the same happens in our organisations: **when we see a problem, the first thing we tend to do is go and fix it**. 

My orchid is teaching me that sometimes it is best to resist the temptation to do 'something', and do nothing instead…it may be that what we think is a problem exists only in our head. <br>
It may also be that there is indeed a problem…which the people suffering from it will be able to solve without that much of an external intervention.

*And if we cannot stay still?* 

>What about directing our energies to trying to **understand what is really the problem we are solving for**?
