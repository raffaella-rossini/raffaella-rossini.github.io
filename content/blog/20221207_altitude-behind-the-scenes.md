# A few words about the event itself 

A couple of weeks ago I was in Barcelona together with around 400 colleagues for [Altitude23](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lastminute%2Ecom_pinkspirit-altitude23-traveltech-activity-7003031642206310400-lJL-), our first **Product and Tech Camp**, that I helped organise together with a handful of colleagues, and that went on for four days. 

## Goals
There are a **lot of new people** in the Product and Technology functions at my company, and the **teams are heavily distributed** across Europe and India. We wanted to provide them with the opportunity to: 

- **get to know each other** better
- **expand personal networks**
- **bond** and **build trust**
- **share knowledge**
- **align** around the vision and strategy for next year

to reinforce the foundations on which to build **better collaboration** in the day by day.

## In-person set-up
We decided for an **in-person event** because in-person interactions can achieve the vast majority of those goals at a **deeper level and faster** than virtual ones.<br>
Additionally, we **live streamed** the parts of the event that made sense to stream, so as to make contents accessible also to the colleagues who could not join us in person.  

## High level agenda
The high level agenda we designed to meet our goals for the event was:

- Our leaders in Product and Technology delivered the first plenary session about vision and strategy.
- Team activities were decided by our Directors, and every team did something different, even outside the venue of the event.
- The breakout sessions in the Open Space were delivered by the attendees themselves. [Here](https://openspaceworld.org/wp2/hho/papers/brief-users-guide-open-space-technology/) is an introduction about the Open Space technology, for those who have never heard about it.

## It was a success in terms of active participation and engagement! What are the reasons? 
A lot of **work and love** went into preparing the Camp, and it showed: the **attendees provided great feedback** (*"I am enjoying every minute”* is one that I’ll never forget), and the **execs** who thought that the time was right to run such an event for that audience were **happy**. <br>
It was an **enriching and rewarding experience** also for me personally.

Now that emotions have (more or less :sweat_smile:) subsided, I want to reflect on what I think the ingredients for such a positive experience have been. There is for sure room for improvement, but here I want to focus on why it was a **success in terms of active participation and engagement**.

In a nutshell, and unsurprisingly for some of you: 

- **autonomy, mastery, purpose**
- **co-creating an experience** with the people it is intended for 
- and some **good tools**.
