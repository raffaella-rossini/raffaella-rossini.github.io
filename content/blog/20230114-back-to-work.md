It's 2023, and 'office work vs remote work' is still trending topic.

What I find most annoying in the conversations, papers, posts about it is the wording "*Back to work*", and "*Back to the office*" when referring to office work for us **knowledge workers**.

Words matter, and what do those words imply *(to me, at least: I don't know if it is any different for a native English speaker)*? 

# "Back to work"

To me "Back to work" implies that when you are not at the office you are actually **enjoying your free time**, or that you are **faffing around**. 

I don't know what has your experience of work outside the office been so far, I am aware every situation is different.<br>
When it comes to me, **it's surprising how little I can get done from the office compared to working from home**.<br>
I think it's because at home:

* the **working hours are entirely allocated to work**. 
On one side there is no time spent in moving around: no commute, no moving from a meeting room to the other (all my videocalls always start right on time, even ahead of time, when all attendees join remotely), no walking to get coffee or lunch.<br>
On the other side there is also less chitchatting (which has its downsides).
* it's **easier to focus**: there is no noise, no distractions, less interruptions.

So, when somebody says that it's time to go "Back to work" I cannot refrain from thinking: "Well, what do you think I have been doing for the past three years or so?"

# "Back to the office"

To me it sounds like: "Now, now, enough of this remote work thing, let's be good boys and keep doing what we were doing before the pandemic".

The last three years forced us to work in a different way than before, and to me it's a treasure to cherish.<br>
We can extract a lot of learning from it, why should we go "back" instead of leveraging on this experience to **propel us forward to new ways of doing things**?
