It's 2023, and 'office work vs remote work' is still trending topic.

What I find most annoying in the conversations, papers, posts about it is the wording "*Back to work*", and "*Back to the office*" when referring to office work for knowledge workers.

Words matter, and what do those words imply *(to me, at least: I don't know if it is any different for a native English speaker)*? 

# "Back to work"

To me "Back to work" implies that when you are not working at the office you are actually **enjoying your free time** instead, or that you are **faffing around**. 

I don't know what has your experience of work outside the office been so far, I am aware every situation is different.<br>
When it comes to me, **it's surprising how little I can get done from the office compared to working from home**.<br>
I think it's because at home:

* the **working hours are entirely allocated to work**.<br>
On one side there is no time spent in moving around: no commute, no moving from a meeting room to the other (all my videocalls always start right on time, even ahead of time, when all attendees join remotely), no walking to get coffee or lunch.<br>
On the other side there is also less chitchatting (which has its downsides).
* it's **easier to focus**: there is no noise, no distractions, less interruptions. I don't have children, and I am lucky enough to count on a dedicated room to carry on work, a husband who respects my boundaries, and good internet connectivity.

So, when somebody says that it's time to go "Back to work" I cannot refrain from thinking: "Well, what do you think I have been doing for the past three years or so?"

# "Back to the office"

The last three years forced us to work in a different way than before, and to me it's a treasure to cherish.<br>
We can extract a lot of learning from it, why should we go "back" instead of leveraging on this experience to evolve and **propel us forward to new ways of doing things**?

I now look at the **office as a tool**: it provides a default space for in person meetings, it is a release valve for the ones who have a noisy or difficult situation at home, it comes equipped with services like reliable internet access and printers, it is a place where you can socialise.<br>
As such, I wish people were allowed to **use it when it's best**, given their personal situation and the type of work at hand.
