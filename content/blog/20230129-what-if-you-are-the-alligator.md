A few months ago I bumped into [this post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dovtsal_psychologicalsafety-activity-6932884544886841344-ed9s), it stuck with me, and from time to time, when I observe some dynamics in the workplace, my mind goes there.

If it's easy for you to take risks, if you can always speak up and ask questions in a public setting, if it's normal for you to reach out to anyone and ask for something...is it thanks to a work environment that is safe and conductive of learning, or is it because you are the alligator?
