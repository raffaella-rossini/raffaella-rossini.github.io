I just came back from the [Voxxed Days Z√ºrich conference](https://voxxeddays.com/zurich/), where I volunteered, as I have for all editions (but one ü´£). 

It's a sort of tradition for me, that started back in 2015 with the first ever edition of the [Voxxed Days Ticino](https://voxxeddays.com/ticino/), and I have still to get tired of the experience! I love being part of the team that reaches the venue before the guests arrive to **make sure that everything is ready for them** üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I am usually focused on the **check-in**, the very first step of their journey at the event, where things better be **fast and frictionless** also when people come in biiiig waves because they were on the same train or bus. 

This year we **welcomed with a smile** around 450 people: from ticket shown to badge printed and handed over it takes **around 5 seconds**.

I know the developers behind [Alf.io](https://alf.io/), the **open source event attendance management system** that is being adopted to cover the lifecycle of the event from ticket distribution, to event management, to reporting and accounting. 

Among other things, they take care of the check-in first hand, and lend a hand to the exhibitors to setup the dedicated app to collect leads, so basically during the event they are surrounded by **all their customers** (organisers, attendees, and exhibitors) **using their product**, and they have evolved it over the years to solve their customers' **pain points**, which they have been able to **observe live**... and I am in the trenches with them! How cool is that?

Here's to many more successful events ü§ô
