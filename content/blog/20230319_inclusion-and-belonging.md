# Social belonging is a fundamental human need

Inclusion and belonging is about **our relationship with others in a group**: it is the sense of **being accepted and included** by those around you, it is **having a voice**, and that **voice be heard**.

Social belonging is a fundamental human need, and we all know how much it **hurts to feel left out** (remember when you were younger and wanted to hang out with your classmates, but some groups within the class were out of your league? No? Lucky you!): **the sensation is akin to physical pain**.

## Why is this important at work?

Well, first of all because, for the biggest part of our adult life, **we spend a significant amount of time with our coworkers**, and spending most of our waking hours in a context where we feel like we do not belong is **harmful to our happiness**.

Secondly, when we **feel excluded** we tend to **shut down and not speak up**, while **feeling like we do belong** allows us to really **contribute and engage**.

So [inclusion and belonging are good for business](https://hbr.org/2019/12/the-value-of-belonging-at-work): they are at the foundation of **innovation** and **improvement**, and have a positive impact on **productivity**.

# For us knowledge workers, belonging and inclusion at team level is pivotal 

The **team is where value is created** in the most rich and sustainable way.

If the **connection is strong at team level** you **can cope** with the challenging and crappy moments at company level, and still be resourceful and resilient.<br>
If the **connection is poor at team** level it doesn’t matter how great your employer is, **your experience at work overall is gonna suffer**.

## Why am I focusing here on remote and hybrid set-ups?

First of all because at my current company they have become standard over the past three years, so it is what I can observe first hand more easily. The vast majority of the **teams are now far more distributed** than before:

- Some teams are entirely **remote based**.
- Other teams are composed of **remote team members and team members who live close to one office**… which is not necessarily the same office: it means that if everyone in the team decides to go to their ‘office of reference’ the same day, people end up in different places. 
- Even when all team members live close to the same office, often **part of the team is at the office and part is not**, since everyone is entitled to work from home for a good part of the month.

Secondly, because they have **their own set of challenges** in respect to inclusion and belonging: 

- **Full remote** set-up **lacks physical proximity**, that tends to facilitate the development of strong ties between people.
- **Hybrid** means people play in a **playing field which is not level**: some can leverage on the physical proximity, some cannot.

You may have noticed that at the end of the title of this blog post there is a question mark: it's because I am still looking for answers!

I've started by asking my colleagues to share:

- **What has been working well** in terms of belonging and inclusion in their teams, so that we could embed those practices in our working style
- **What has actively damaged** that sense of belonging and inclusion, so that we can increase awareness and avoid the same missteps.

I'll share their insights in the next post.
